"""Lab 5: simulated defocus.

Over the next few weeks we cover camera focus and defocus, and projector
focus and defocus. This lab is a hand-crafted way of understanding them: a
real lens blurs each part of the scene by an amount that depends on its
depth, and here we fake that with masks drawn by hand.

Inputs, next to this file:
    image.jpg                  a photo with many different depths in it
    mask1.png, mask2.png, ...  one image per depth layer, the same size as
                               the photo, white where that layer is and
                               black elsewhere (paint them, or use Segment
                               Anything or Depth Anything, see the lab page)
Run:
    python defocus.py
Outputs:
    defocus1.png, ...   the photo with everything outside mask k blurred
    masks.png           every mask in one image; does it look like depth?
